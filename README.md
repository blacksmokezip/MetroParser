The program extracts information about products from a specific category on the METRO online store and saves it into a JSON file.

All necessary dependencies are installed within the poetry virtual environment and are listed in both pyproject.toml and requirements.txt.

To modify the product category, simply update the value of the "url" variable in the main.py file.
